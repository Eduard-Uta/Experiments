1. [Delete garbage files]
- DIY way to automatically delete files or folders that are no longer needed (garbage) from the Download(s) folder(s).
The tool of choice for the scripting is Powershell and the automation is completed with a simple, basic Task Scheduler task.
/!\ Please use this with care (as it implies permanent deletion of files and/or folders within particular folders)!
